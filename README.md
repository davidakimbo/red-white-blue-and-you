## Red White Blue and You!
### Political Transparency made easy by David Kim

Politicians! We sure don't the heck out of them don't we? Even though Congress has a 15% approval rating, there's 90% incumbancy! These senators and representatives must be real likable people if they really stink at their jobs yet they can still keep them. 

There's a lot of citizen apathy in the political system and what I hope to ameliorate that with RED WHITE BLUE AND YOU!
